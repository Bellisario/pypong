# PyPong

Pong game written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).

## Development

To get started, clone the repository and `cd` it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bellisario/pypong.git
cd pypong
```

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the game with:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

When you're done with your changes, run the following command to build the executable (for your platform):

```bash
pyinstaller main.spec
```

## Why?

I always wanted to remake Pong and I finally decided to spend some time with this idea while mastering my Python knowledge and learning Pygame.

> I had so much fun with this project, and I hope you'll appreciate the result, as this is my first "real" project in Python!

If you find some missing Python optimizations or "non-pythonic" code, feel free to contribute making this project better!
